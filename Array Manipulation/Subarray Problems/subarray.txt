Most of the subarray questions are based on the fact that the array elements are continuous so we should exploit this fact to our advantage. We can use two pointers anytime to calculate the Brute-force solution. But our aim is to decrease the time complexity for this we should conisder some standard ways of solving our problem. Which are:

-> The concept of Sliding Window.
-> The concept of prefix sum. 

Two pointer is a very important technique to handle any array subarray problem. Their are hidden facts in the questions and pattern which once found will help to solve the problem. we can keep a track of max and min element. While also the count of an element. 

The art is to think out of the box and always in reverse manner if you have given certain amount of thought to the cliche techniques. Think in terms of not equal to then what? What if elements are swapped? What is I try iterating in reverse manner? What if I manipulate with index? These are some question which should come in your mind while approaching a problem.
